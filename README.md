### Overview of the Project
The objective of this project is to analyze the impact of different advertising mediums (TV, Radio, Newspaper) on sales using the Advertising dataset. The goal is to build a predictive model that accurately forecasts sales based on the advertising budget across these mediums, and to understand the relationship between each advertising channel and sales.

### Key Activities
1.**Data Loading and Initial Exploration:**
->Load the Advertising dataset and perform an initial inspection to understand its structure.
->View the first few records, data types, and check for any missing values.

2.**Data Cleaning:**
->Handle any issues in the dataset such as removing unnecessary columns (e.g., Unnamed: 0).
->Ensure all relevant columns (TV, Radio, Newspaper, Sales) are properly formatted and ready for analysis.

3.**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
->Analyze the distribution of advertising budgets across different mediums and their relationship with sales.
->Use descriptive statistics to summarize the dataset and visualize the relationships between the variables.

4.**Feature Selection:**
->Select relevant features (TV, Radio, Newspaper) as predictors and Sales as the target variable.
->Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

5.**Model Building:**
->Develop a Linear Regression model to predict sales based on the advertising budget.
->Fit the model to the training data and make predictions on the test data.

6.**Visualization:**
->Create scatter plots to visualize the relationship between advertising budgets and sales.
->Plot the regression line on training data and compare it with actual sales values.
->Display the scatter plot of predicted vs. actual sales values for the test data.

7.**Conclusion:**
->Summarize the key findings, particularly the effectiveness of each advertising medium on sales.
->Discuss the modelâ€™s accuracy and potential areas for improvement.
